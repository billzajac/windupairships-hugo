Preface: I do not endorse my actions from this story, or those of anyone involved. They were poorly thought out and poorly executed ideas that somehow never resulted in any serious injuries or legal situations. My memory is also faulty, so I may have missed details, misattributed details, or even created completely fictional details. This was a long time ago, and I often struggle to remember what I had for lunch.

Anton Chekov advised, “If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired.” Based on that, I’ll start with the Snapple. But the gun was probably the table leg, but I think I have to mention the Snapple first.

When I was in college, Snapple still wasn’t a well known brand in our area. At least, I don’t think I had heard of it. But apparently they wanted to do a marketing push, so they shipped a bunch of cases to our university, but those bottles were never distributed for some reason. Then they expired. And hundreds of beautiful glass bottles with little facts under their lids sat, possibly hidden, apparently forgotten in a basement storage room of at least one dorm, ours, Hand college in Tabler quad. That is, until we discovered them.

I don’t recall which one of us discovered the storage room in the basement. Maybe the door was unlocked. Maybe we did the credit card trick. Of course, none of us had credit cards, and if we did, we wouldn’t be dumb enough to ruin one trying to open locked doors, but we felt pretty comfortable ruining our student IDs, and the trick worked surprisingly well on the right kind of door. So we felt it was important to learn what kind of doors were vulnerable.

I feel like it was Oscar or Tom who first came running back to our suite to tell us about the discovery. At first, I didn’t want to take any. I was concerned about getting in trouble for theft. After realizing that the cases were all significantly expired, but not too expired to enjoy, we had a constant supply of a sugary drink in beautiful glass bottles. We always had at least one case in the suite for entertaining guests, most of whom would come by via our window. Our suite was on the first floor, and since many of our friends didn’t officially live in the building, or even live on campus in John’s case, they simply jumped in or out through our window. It was really convenient. John could park on the grass in front of our window and the campus police rarely seemed to look there to give him a ticket. That said, his car was one of their favorites to ticket. The white Mitsubishi, or as Kumi would say, the Meechubeechee. Her accent was unbearably cute.

One day, we were sitting around having a heated debate as to whether or not we could throw an empty Snapple through the window, which was only open about 6 inches. It was a standard hypothetical debate, and many of us were tempted to try, but since we would have to replace the window, and it would be obvious that we were the ones who smashed it, none of us took the chance. That is, until John showed up. John was surprisingly skilled with hand eye coordination. He was really impressive on the tennis court, and could hold his own in basketball. Not that I even once played with or against him in either. I had zero interest in any sport in college. John immediately grabbed the bottle to size it up. He made a few test throw movements, but it was too late when I realized he was actually going to throw it. He missed. Or maybe you could say it was a hit, and our large window crashed to pieces. Thankfully mostly outside. I remember seeing Oscar seemed quite pleased.

We realized that to replace the window, we could lift it out of the tracks, but it had to be done from the inside. That night, we went to Douglass college, the building next door, and found a replacement window on the ground floor lobby. When everyone was asleep, we switched it out with ours. Problem solved.

As time and Snapple bottles flew by, we eventually ended up replacing every other window available. There were fewer than we thought. The windows were not all the same size. There were maybe 6 that we could find. And one by one, we replaced them all. Then the fun stopped.

Until one day, or probably night, I found a broken table in the center of the quad. Since it was dorm furniture, it was very sturdy, so the act of further destroying it was a nice challenge. I ripped off one of the legs, and it came off with a large metal plate that had previously kept it attached to the table. Being so sports oriented, although not sports involved, I immediately recognized that it would make a great golf club, aka an even better tool for destruction. The golf club made its way back to our suite and was a source of entertainment and many hypothetical discussions, including whether we could throw it through the gap in the window. Of course we all knew that probably no human would possess that skill. That is, until John showed up.

I insisted that John could not play with the golf club until he promised not to destroy our last window. This apparently brought out the creative thinker in John. He promised and took the club, then pivoted and swung the plate right into the wall opposite the window. My memory tells me that Oscar goaded him, but again, my memory is imperfect. That table leg was a piece of art for weeks until we finally had to move out to graduate. When we pulled it from the wall, a massive chunk of drywall came out with it, so before we repaired it and repainted, we put the note we had gotten from the RA about “excessive wood” into a ziplock and stuffed it in behind the beautifully repaired wall.

I guess I should share more about excessive wood, and maybe the time I accidentally threw the dart that stuck into the side of Chris Amato’s head, or maybe the time we marched to the half-frozen Roth pond for a midnight swim. But these are just the stories from Tabler quad. There were so many from the year before at Roosevelt, and so many more from Kelly quad.
