## The poem with initially recognizable words

> The poem combined looks like this at first
> My lustful and furious hunger
> Frenetically consuming it all
> Stop and the truth will cease evasion
> 
> My constant search for food then meaning
> Satiation brings only temporary peace
> Searching occupies body and mind
> Stillness

## Decrypted

You probably noticed there are additional strings of letters at the end of each EXIF description line inside square brackets

When you decrypt those with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 and con(cat)enate (append) those to one word in the final verse, it changes (dramatically I think) to this
> My lustful and furious hunger
> Frenetically consuming it all
> Stop and the truth will cease evasion
> 
> My constant search for food then meaning
> Satiation brings only temporary peace
> Searching occupies body and mind
> Stillness unnecessary to experience the majesty of all

## Meaning

Q: Why would I do this?

A: This series of images and words, as well as the process one would go through to attain the highest and most complete understanding is intended to mimic my experiences so far with awakening.

This is intended to guide you through an experience of apparently stark differences between two schools of thought around enlightenment. 

* The first thing you see when you look deeply at the images (by looking into the EXIF metadata of the files), is that there is more information than just the obviously visual component of the image.
* Then when you look at that information all together, you are able to quickly find a poem that describes the work you must do obtain it.
* As you study the information more closely you will find the ROT13 encoded information.
    * It might take longer to determine how to access the information in there and some people may not even notice it.
    * But if you do, you will see a more complete poem, with a different meaning.
    * The new meaning of the poem is also a description of the path that you took to get here.

To be explicit, the incomplete verse is intended to imply that we need to work hard to find stillness, peace, and ultimate enlightenment.
The complete verse was there all along, just a bit more difficult to see. It states that we don't need to work. Perfection is here always and is unavoidable, whether we are aware of it or not.
The complete poem is no better than the incomplete poem, and some people might enjoy the images ... or not, and that's all perfect.
