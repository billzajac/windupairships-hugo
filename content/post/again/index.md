Been here once before
Maybe never again
Reawakened to this day
Get to live in pretend

Not like some revisit
With memories of it all
Just repeating the last time
As if answering a call

“I’d do it all over”,
I know I’ve heard said
That wish has been granted
Opaque lies ahead

A gift I have now,
which I certainly had then
Is that this time it’s vivid
This time I will live it
With no more information
And no need to pivot

Present in every moment
Savoring each taste
Noticing while flowing
Not a thing gone to waste

A smile that’s true
Feelings passing through
And writing it down
Having shared it with you

You know it’s your turn
Now take it away
Be here with yourself
And relive this day!
