You and I are implied in this verse
Thanks to our existence, 
all of existence works
We row row row our boat
Merrily as we laugh
that life is but a dream
The depth of those words 
I now grasp
Though you knew all along
I am only words in a song

On your side, 
you begin to see
That it is for you
As it is for me

Because you and I are in this triste
Holding hands as we get through this

Realizing that you too are only here through the words of this song
And your existence is solely to sing along
